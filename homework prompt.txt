**Design the homework using this structure:**

**SECTION A: Description & Identification (easier questions)**
- Can students identify substances/systems using properties, reactions, composition, or structure?
- Test if students have learned the basic concepts (one idea per question)

**SECTION B: Explanation & Prediction (medium questions)**  
- Can students explain WHY properties/behaviors happen?
- Can students predict what will happen in new situations?
- Test if students can use ideas about particles, forces between particles, or energy

**SECTION C: Making Connections (harder questions - optional extension)**
- Can students connect MULTIPLE ideas to solve complex problems?
- Can students evaluate explanations or compare different approaches?

**Format requirements:**
1. Include a mark scheme with common wrong answers identified
2. Add "Teaching Notes" that tell me:
   - Which questions test which ideas
   - Where students will probably fail and why
   - What to do if most students get it wrong
   - Which questions struggling students should skip
3. Give realistic time estimates (don't assume students work fast)

**Make it diagnostic, not just evaluative:** 
I want to see WHAT students don't understand yet, not just WHETHER they got it right.

Design questions so that wrong answers reveal specific gaps in understanding.
